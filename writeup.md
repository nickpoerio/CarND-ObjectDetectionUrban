## Object Eetection in Urban Environment

### Project overview
Perception is crucial in the Automated Driving pipeline, as the first
For this project, we will be training a **Single Shot Detector** (paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf), baseline pretrained mode [here](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz)) using data from the [Waymo Open dataset](https://waymo.com/open/).

### Dataset
#### Dataset analysis
This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts and other visualizations.
#### Cross validation
This section should detail the cross validation strategy and justify your approach.

### Training 
#### Reference experiment
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should includes training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performances.

#### Improve on the reference
This section should highlight the different strategies you adopted to improve your model. It should contain relevant figures and details of your findings.
